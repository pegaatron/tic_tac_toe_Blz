## Background
> This web app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built on a MERN stack.

In this full-stack web app, users can challenge a computer to a game of tic-tac-toe. This application supports user logins, which tracks and stores their score history (wins, losses, and ties). To spice up the game, there are two modes that can be played: easy and hard, where hard mode models human-playing behavior with the intention to win. Similarly to a real game, turns will be selected randomly as well.

## Demo
